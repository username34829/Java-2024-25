## All code is created from 2024-2025

Im 19 years old and im typing this in Aug|17|2025 | 00:41 AM

i decided to upload all my practice, exercise and activity here right now in java.
all the other code is from 2024 when i haven't use github.

as you can see most of them repeated practice or same files, its because i stoped for a month and get back of coding and revisiting all the basic concept,
but as of now, im aiming to master this language at this very moment im typing this.

sorry looks mess, im new here and i dont know much about anything here.
so no judge here, just explore.

**[Update]**  
note that the OOP folder and inside of the topic folder (in src folder file) have the same file name of "Main.java" and "Pen.java"
i use the same file with different topic and update them when uploading it here. 
the reason for this is because i can learn faster when i use the same object (or class) on the topic. i pair them and see how it changes overtime when learning new concept.
tho by the end of my learning in OOP im going to create a new Folder about project (it consist of basic, intermid, and OOP concept)

**[Update]**  
hi, i added an exercise folder, the purpose of this is to challenge myself and for revisiting some concept if needed.

**[Update]**  
i added project folder. soon im going to organize everything here. i'll track the date of all the file and upload it in one folder called "2024-Java"
also im going to create "2025-Aug Java" which all the code of 2025 to Aug when i havent use github.

**[Update]**  
done organising files, i named the folder "Java-2024" and "Java-2025"

**[Update]**  
hi, im depressed again, and again abt myself, world and life itself. idk if i can master this lang.

thats all. thanks.
